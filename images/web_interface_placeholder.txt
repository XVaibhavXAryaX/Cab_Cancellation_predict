WEB INTERFACE SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

To complete the README.md with the web interface image:

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: http://localhost:5000
3. Take a screenshot of the Flask application interface
4. Save it as: web_interface.png
5. Replace this placeholder file with the actual screenshot

The screenshot should show:
- The main form with all input fields
- The "Predict Cancellation" button
- The "Train Model" section
- The overall layout and styling

This will make the README.md complete with all visualizations!
